Significant growth of internet users signifies that more autonomous systems need to be designed. Software-Defined Network (SDN) replaces traditional networks due to their solubility and capability to integrate with artificial intelligence. It also makes networking future poof. A technological shift often comes with shortcomings, and SDN is no exception. Anomaly detection is a crucial task. Existing anomaly detection methods use traditional statistical and machine learning-based models that may perform poorly due to two key issues: (i) the unavailability of all training network-packets at the beginning since these packets are received over time and the training dataset gradually grows over time, and (ii) limited memory and computation capacity of the computing system for model building, preventing the storage of all network-packets that arrive over time for a prolonged period. To address the issues, this paper introduces a novel functionality in SDN called Adaptive anomaly Detection Method (ADM), which utilises an existing technique for facilitating incremental learning so that ADM can handle new anomaly types by keeping track of historical information. ADM is evaluated using four criteria by comparing its performances against four state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADM performs significantly better than existing techniques.
