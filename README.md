<h2>ADM</h2>
ADM utilises an existing technique for facilitating incremental learning so that it can handle new anomaly types by keeping track of historical information. ADM is evaluated using four criteria by comparing its performances against four state-of-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADM performs significantly better than existing techniques.
